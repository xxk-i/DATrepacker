# DATrepacker
DAT file repacker for NIER:AUTOMATA

Usage: `python repacker.py <directory>`

Takes all the files within a given directory and repacks them into a .dat/.dtt file used by Nier Automata.
These can be packed into dataXXX.cpk's and loaded into the game.

Here's a demo of what is possible:
